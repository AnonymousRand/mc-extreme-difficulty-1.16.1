todo:
	reorganize all custommobs to use new attacks thing and whatever (including blaze)
	
	breakblocksaround goals make sure never remove blocks underneath unless intentional?
	
	pay with targetchance in nearestattackabletarget; seems to try and stagger execution of goals?
	
	iron golem bug s till tries to attack other entities after plaayer goes into creative (and also calls statmultiply from listener?)
	
	fix iron golem spawning with iron blocks not removing iron blocks
	
	villagerdamage and death listeners from raidandvillager to just mob damage? and rename raidandvillager to just raid
			
	less hacky way for bukkitplayer set velocity runnable in playerdamagelistener? setDeltaMovement() from forge; check spigot equiv (for lauunching player)
	
	iron golem sethelath in increashealthadd change to heal? and make sure works
	
	registerGenericAttribute() into util with static?
	
	should all utils be static? id tech has them static
	
	capitalize all after /** and try to move all to new lines
	
	balancing and small nerfs like ghast or something, more consistent but less endermites on enderman death etc, no magma cube spawns from blaze
	
	make lava spread fast in overworld if possible?
	
	swap grass and tall grass effects
	
	remove blank line before cobnstrcutors/fields
		
	dont add customhurtbytarget in vanillapthfindergoalsaccess? and do it individually
	
	hoglin fire trails to custom goal?
	
	should reflection fields be static?
	
	phantom more linear size increases?
	
	phantom check that die() override delay doesn't matter
	
	check all the goals comments esp ranged to add clarification to y level (all from the entities' overridden .g() or whatever), and make sure also specified regardless of LOS
	
	see if possible to not have .g() and whatever in all entities and just use a new version in the attacking goals (3 ranged, 2 melee) and custompathfindertargetcondition that passes in both entities and does a check there instead
	
	move some broadcast messages like the end of the dragon fight to disaply full screen? search google for how
	
	less uber long lines
	
	piglin frenzy etc use proper getters and setters
	
	piglin still attacks in creative (isinvulnerable check somewhere?)
	
	bug: piglins seem to still drop item theyre holding; check other mobs too
	
	fake illusioner little damage but big tankiness
	
	copy all a() b() etc documentation from passivemeleeattack goal to all goals
	
	create full documentation from all /** comments?
	
	custompathfindergoaltarget: instead of switch cases, just check if instanceof iattacklevelingmob?
	
	try to clean up big removepathfindergoals switch statement? potentially using interface for those needing a removal so we have a getvanillatargetselector() or something, and also an initvanilletargetselector() for this.targetSelectorVanilla = super.targetSelector;
	
	see if possible to create utils for shooting large and small fireballs etc?
	
	getbuffedbymobs goal: increase attacks by a percentage
	
	try to move stuff from listeners like listenermobdeath to the mobs themselves
	
	some utils like spawn entity DO NOT have to be runnables; check performance and also check what runnables actually do (if theyre not async, theyre useless?)
	
	creeper, phantom etc try having custom init for initFuse() or whatever instead of constructor and doing hacky reflection stuff in spawnentity. and pass entity instance to spawnentity instead of all this forced compatability with constructors? also dragon uuid? also fake illuisioner parent? or have like a second constrcutor without out the extra init calling this() with a default value for spawnentity or something
	
	those thbat do something upon death, like ghasts abnd evokers that do it in tick(), check if there is a function that is called before death so don't have to do it in tick()
	
	check weather changes works
	
	try to debofuscate goals using idtech thing, experiment with changing seetime requirement etc
	
	change back all casts to have space
	
	util functions to set (decrease or increase) max health and health?
	
	more creative effects for mooshroom milking (maybe random sus stew with most chance for bad effects instead)
	
	reduce magma cube jump distance so they dont overshoot following range
	
	break blocks ruunnable instead of booleans to remove dluuids etc just pass in a static predicate to the constrcutor
	
	slimes and magma blocks sometimes just run away?
	
	check balance for slime/magma cube damage and melee attack radius
	
	players still lose bubbles slower when fully submerged than when feet submerged
	
	players dont lose bubbles when feet submerged and not moving due to playermovelistener being used
	
	mobs still taking magma block damage?
	
	slimes and mamga cubes still get trapped in cobwebs; just break them?
	
	mobs dont get affected by soul sand or magma blocks in water
	
	
balance changes catalog:
	striders die faster
