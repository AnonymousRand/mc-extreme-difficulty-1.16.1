todo:

    overriden functions like checkdespawn try to use descriptive variable names

    comment syntax update, line lengths, remove last newline, space after cast, standard multiline comment for changes docs. stopped after: customentitybee

    listeners group by event?

    nms, bukkit etc labels use underscore?

    check what happens when you dont allow friendly fire in custompathfindertargetcondition for bat and evoker

    check if bat customtargetcondition thingy needs follow range > 4.0

    catalog and test super zombie health nerf + xp health gain

    custom class for large fireball summon lightning and separate newpathfindergoalshootlargefireballs too; also test todo in lightning storm runnable

	reorganize all custommobs to use new attacks thing and whatever (including blaze)

	change custompathfindergoaltarget k() to just use icustomhostile.getfollowrange() instead of massive switch?

	investigate why some mobs dont need bl() (maxfallheight) or g() and d() or checkdesapwn()

	optimize predicates (not bedrock into base? etc)

	standardize customentity.this vs this.customentity in inner goal classes

	todo comments in like elder guardian

    todo increment attacks in attack method/goal instead of listener?

    comment/javadoc custom goals functions. see customentityblaze inner class for example

    attacks comments/docs all into initattack method instead of increase attacks?

    all -- and ++ to after if possible

    check if still possible to piston blocks above 128

    check that bats never sleep

    remove unnecessary casts???

    util function for Bukkit.getServer().getOnlinePlayers().size()?

	breakblocksaround goals make sure never remove blocks underneath unless intentional?

	pay with targetchance in nearestattackabletarget; seems to try and stagger execution of goals?

	iron golem bug s till tries to attack other entities after plaayer goes into creative (and also calls statmultiply from listener?)

	fix iron golem spawning with iron blocks not removing iron blocks

	villagerdamage and death listeners from raidandvillager to just mob damage? and rename raidandvillager to just raid

	less hacky way for bukkitplayer set velocity runnable in playerdamagelistener? setDeltaMovement() from forge; check spigot equiv (for lauunching player)

	iron golem sethelath in increashealthadd change to heal? and make sure works

	registerGenericAttribute() into util with static? pass in this. pulling attributemap too

	should all utils be static? id tech has them static

	capitalize all after /* and try to move all to new lines

	balancing and small nerfs like ghast or something, more consistent but less endermites on enderman death etc, no magma cube spawns from blaze

	make lava spread fast in overworld if possible?

	swap grass and tall grass effects

	remove blank line before cobnstrcutors/fields

	dont add customhurtbytarget in vanillapthfindergoalsaccess? and do it individually

	hoglin fire trails to custom goal?

	should reflection fields be static? in line with this: reflection util to hide try catch and stuff?

	phantom more linear size increases?

	phantom check that die() override delay doesn't matter

	lower magma cube spawn replacement chance? unless no spawn from blaze is enough of a nerf

	check all the goals comments esp ranged to add clarification to y level (all from the entities' overridden .g() or whatever), and make sure also specified regardless of LOS

	see if possible to not have .g() and whatever in all entities and just use a new version in the attacking goals (3 ranged, 2 melee) and custompathfindertargetcondition that passes in both entities and does a check there instead

	make dragon fight logic cleaner, as well as ending messages? find exploits

	move some broadcast messages like the end of the dragon fight to disaply full screen? search google for how

	piglin frenzy etc use proper getters and setters

	piglin still attacks in creative (isinvulnerable check somewhere?)

	bug: piglins seem to still drop item theyre holding; check other mobs too

	fake illusioner little damage but big tankiness

	copy all a() b() etc documentation from passivemeleeattack goal to all goals

	custompathfindergoaltarget: instead of switch cases, just check if instanceof iattacklevelingmob?

	try to clean up big removepathfindergoals switch statement? potentially using interface for those needing a removal so we have a getvanillatargetselector() or something, and also an initvanilletargetselector() for this.targetSelectorVanilla = super.targetSelector;

	see if possible to create utils for shooting large and small fireballs etc?

	getbuffedbymobs goal: increase attacks by a percentage

	try to move stuff from listeners like listenermobdeath to the mobs themselves

	some utils like spawn entity DO NOT have to be runnables; check performance and also check what runnables actually do (if theyre not async, theyre useless?)

	creeper, phantom etc try having custom init for initFuse() or whatever instead of constructor and doing hacky reflection stuff in spawnentity. and pass entity instance to spawnentity instead of all this forced compatability with constructors? also dragon uuid? also fake illuisioner parent? or have like a second constrcutor without out the extra init calling this() with a default value for spawnentity or something

    wrap spawnentity in util function that creates runnable instance so we dont need awkward new every time?

	those thbat do something upon death, like ghasts abnd evokers that do it in tick(), check if there is a function that is called before death so don't have to do it in tick()

	check weather changes works

	try to debofuscate goals using idtech thing, experiment with changing seetime requirement etc

	change back all casts to have space

	util functions to set (decrease or increase) max health and health?

	more creative effects for mooshroom milking (maybe random sus stew with most chance for bad effects instead)

	reduce magma cube jump distance so they dont overshoot following range

	break blocks ruunnable instead of booleans to remove dluuids etc just pass in a static predicate to the constrcutor

	slimes and magma blocks sometimes just run away?

	check balance for slime/magma cube damage and melee attack radius

	players still lose bubbles slower when fully submerged than when feet submerged

	players dont lose bubbles when feet submerged and not moving due to playermovelistener being used

	mobs still taking magma block damage?

	slimes and mamga cubes still get trapped in cobwebs; just break them?

	mobs dont get affected by soul sand or magma blocks in water

	create full documentation of changes from all /* comments and that google doc?

balance changes catalog:
	striders die faster (find number!)
	elder guardian random despawn distance increased from 60 to 64 blocks (why did i ever make it 60???)
	blaze inaccuracy non rapidfire 0% -> 20% vanilla
	blaze inaccuracy rapidfire 35% -> 250% vanilla
	blaze normal attack cooldown 4 ticks -> 6; no pause between volleys remains unchanged
	blaze rapidfire attack cooldown 3 ticks -> 4
	(this was more of a bug) blaze melee cooldown 0 ticks -> 20
